1. Executive Summary
SkyFi is developing an AI-driven feature, "Enterprise Company Verification Intelligence," to enhance the integrity of our self-service registration process for Enterprise accounts. This feature will automatically verify business entities during registration, mitigating risks such as fraudulent company creation and misrepresentation. By utilizing AI to gather and verify company information from across the internet, we aim to replace the current manual review process, increasing accuracy and efficiency while reducing the potential for human error.
2. Problem Statement
SkyFi's self-service registration for Enterprise accounts is vulnerable to risks including account hijacking, company misrepresentation, and the registration of non-existent companies to bypass compliance checks. The current manual review process is slow, error-prone, and dependent on the operator's expertise. Moreover, the absence of a global company registry complicates verification. Our goal is to automate this process using AI to collect, verify, and assess company information, providing a risk score that aids in compliance checks.
3. Goals & Success Metrics
* Accuracy Improvement: Increase accuracy of company verifications by 80%
* Efficiency: Reduce time spent on manual reviews by 70%
* Compliance: Achieve 95% compliance with business standards and reduce fraudulent registrations
* Risk Assessment: Implement a reliable risk scoring system for company registrations
4. Target Users & Personas
* Compliance Officers: Require accurate and efficient verification processes to ensure compliance with regulations
* IT Security Teams: Need robust systems to prevent fraudulent access and data breaches
* Business Analysts: Require reliable data to make informed decisions about potential business partnerships
